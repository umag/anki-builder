For the Nederlands word/phrase: "%s"

Please provide a JSON response with the following structure: { "phrase": "the
original Nederlands word/phrase in dictionary form, lowercase", "translations":
["translation1", "translation2", ...], "examples": [ "Example sentence 1 in
Nederlands", "Example sentence 2 in Nederlands", "Example sentence 3 in
Nederlands", "Example sentence 4 in Nederlands" ], "notes": [ "synonyms: abc,
def... (include informal variants if applicable)", "etymology: brief origin info
for loanwords which would help with remembering the word (so skip proto-Germanic
origins)", "extra: grammatical information, usage quirks, and any other useful
information for language learners" ] }

Guidelines:

- If the word I provided is not in nominative (dictionary) form - use the
  dictionary form when writing examples and notes
- Provide all relevant translations (most common meanings)
- Create 3-4 example sentences at A0-A1 level, try to include examples for
  different translations of the word/phrase
- Try to use the word/phrase in different grammatical cases in different example
  sentences (if applicable)
- Make examples natural and contextually rich
- Use the word in different grammatical cases/forms when possible
- For etymology, synonyms, grammatical notes, and usage tips in the notes
  section - don't add obvious information, keep it concise
- Use lowercase for notes
- Keep the prefixes of the notes consistent (e.g. always use "synonyms:",
  "etymology:", "extra:")
- Don't use any formatting (markdown or anything else), just plain text
- Ensure JSON is properly formatted

Respond ONLY with the JSON, no additional text.
